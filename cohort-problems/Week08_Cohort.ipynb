The state diagram does not show what the machine would do if an unexpected coin is inserted. Therefore, assume that any unexpected coin is returned to the user without a change in the machines state. Thus, on your own, you may want to complete the Figure below to add in the missing transitions.\n",

For example, the arc that connects state 0 to state 1 that’s labelled `50/(50, ’--’,0)` means that when the dispenser receives 50¢ (50 before the /) in state 0, it moves to state 1 and generates an output of `(50, ’--’,0)`. This tuple of values in the output indicates that the dispenser display shows 50 which is the amount deposited by the user, no coke has been dispensed yet as indicated by `--`, and no change has been returned to the user as indicated by the last entry which is a 0.\n",

If a dollar coin is deposited, the machine continues to display 0, dispenses coke, and does not return any money (well, why should it!).\n",
